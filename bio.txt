I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology (Manipal), India in 2020, and an M.S. in Hydrosystems Engineering from ASU with a research project aimed at assessing the utility of different precipitation estimates and forecasts for prediction of urban flooding. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Hydrosystems Engineering focused on the generation of high-resolution climate data for infrastructure modeling.
